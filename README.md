# Log.Horst

A fresh way to view and analyze your application logs. 

Project is very new - I'm working on separating the client library so this can be consumed by any application. Future work also includes an iOS and Android log viewer app.

The premise is that by decorating your logs with simple (human readable) metadata, this tool will be able to parse out those logs and apply powerful filters and visualizations for you to know exactly what was going on in the application at the time of the logs.

Stay tuned for more updates!
